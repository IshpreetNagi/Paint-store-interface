# Paint Store Interface
 This was another program I had created as a summative for my grade 12 computer science class. The program is themed to be a pain store interface where you can shop for different colors of paint, adding them to your cart, and then paying through cash-or-credit at the end of your shopping spree. Again to reiterate, even though this code was orginally created for the purpose of being a summative project for my grade 12 computer science class, it uses no instructor provided starter code and has been completely written by me.

 ### Pre-requisites
